Sorting algorithms
---

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at**ALX SE Programme** and **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort and so on) and Big O Notation in **C language.**

Technologies
---
* Scripts written in Bash
* C files are compiled using `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

All of the following programs are written in C:
